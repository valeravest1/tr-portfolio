## Writing samples

#### -Academic writing: [Thesis](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/Thesis_Valentina_Ravest.pdf)

This text corresponds to a master thesis that explores a linguistic phenomenon using machine learning techniques. It contains hypothesis formulations, theoretical analysis of bibliography, description of methodologies, explanation of processes and analysis of results.

#### -Scientific writing:[Abstract of a paper presented at a conference-Spanish version](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/155049863/Libro_de_Res_menes_Actas_III_CILCC_2020_y_V_WoPATeC_2020_Virtual_.pdf#page=294)

This text corresponds to the abstract of the paper presented at the International Congress on Corpus Linguistics 2020 and Workshop on Automated Text Processing WOPATEC 2020. This abstract is inserted in the proceedings of the conference and aims to explain in a general way what the presentation was about. The original language is Spanish, but a translated version into English can be found [here](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/WOPATEC%20en.pdf)

## Programmimg samples

#### -R Programming: [Machine Learning applied to Corpus Linguistics](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/code_thesis_r.ipynb)
This is the code written in R used to perform machine learning algorithms in a project related to Corpus Linguistics. Inferential trees and random forest are created to determine the stylistic characteristics of 19th century english authors.

#### -Python programming: [Neural Networks for Sentimient Analysis](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/Neural_BERT_HW_solution_adapted.ipynb)
This is the code written in Python used to perform sentiment analysis, using Neural Networks. This code was part of a competition held in a course at the University of Antwerp with the aim of obtaining the best model to identify negativity in social network texts and was awarded as the winner of the [competition.](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/digital-text-analysis/about-the-programme/taste-of-dta/)

#### -Latex formating: [LaTex Thesis](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/latex-thesis-formating.tex)
This is the code used to format text using LaTex. This results in a PDF text that follows basic conventions established by the scientific community for text publishing. The final result for this document is the master thesis presented above.
