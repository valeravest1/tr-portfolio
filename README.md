## Writing samples

#### -Academic writing: [Thesis](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/Thesis_Valentina_Ravest.pdf)

This text corresponds to a master thesis that explores a linguistic phenomenon using machine learning techniques. It contains hypothesis formulations, theoretical analysis of bibliography, description of methodologies, explanation of processes and analysis of results.

#### -Scientific writing:[Abstract of a paper presented at a conference-Spanish version](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/155049863/Libro_de_Res_menes_Actas_III_CILCC_2020_y_V_WoPATeC_2020_Virtual_.pdf#page=294)

This text corresponds to the abstract of the paper presented at the International Congress on Corpus Linguistics 2020 and Workshop on Automated Text Processing WOPATEC 2020. This abstract is inserted in the proceedings of the conference and aims to explain in a general way what the presentation was about. The original language is Spanish, but a translated version into English can be found [here](https://github.com/valeravest1/portfolio/blob/main/WOPATEC%20en.pdf)
